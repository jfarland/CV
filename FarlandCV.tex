%	SELECTED PROJECT WORK
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSection}{Selected Project Work}

\begin{rSubsection}{Caltrack Beta Test}{}{Lead Data Scientist}{San Francisco, California}
\item[] Primary code base developer for rapid measurement of site-level, weather normalized energy savings. Process and predictive results benchmarked across open-source implementations from \href{https://github.com/impactlab/caltrack}{Open EE Meter}. Algorithms implemented using R, Python and the Spark distributed computing framework on compute-optimized instances in the Amazon cloud.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Global Energy Transition Outlook}{}{Technical Advisor}{Oslo, Norway}
\item[] Technical advisor for DNV GL's Energy Transition Outlook (ETO). This annual report seeks to identify and measure the major industry implications of the ongoing global energy transition for each of the OECD's regions. Developed bottom-up and top-down predictions of energy demand for each region of the globe until 2040. 
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Hierarchical Forecasting of Energy and Peak Demand in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia}{}{Senior Data Scientist}{Riyadh, Saudia Arabia}
\item[] Data analytics and modeling for the largest end-use metering project in the world. Developed and delivered a three-day course on predictive analytics to subsequently train analytical staff at client site in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Seminar participants included staff from Saudi Aramco, Saudi Electricity Company, and the Electricity and Cogeneration Regulatory Authority. 
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Day-Ahead Forecasting of Demand Response Impacts Utility Distribution Grid}{}{Lead Data Scientist}{San Francisco, California}
\item[] Lead Data Scientist on project demonstrating the feasibility of using hourly, premise-level advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) data for day ahead demand response forecasting. The models estimated         reference load and load curtailment due to peak period demand surcharges. The premise level models were developed and trained primarily using cross-validation techniques. The forecast results were aggregated up distribution hierarchy to produce program load reduction forecasts. The project demonstrated the feasibility of using premise level models within a simulated production environment.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Behavioural Demand Response Evaluation}{}{Project Manager}{Ottawa, Canada}
\item[] Project Manager and Lead Data Scienstist for an impact evaluation pertaining to a hybrid energy program targeting both ongoing behavioural impacts as well as event-based hourly demand reductions. Analytics and reporting were generated using the Spark (1.5) distributed computing framework, Amazon Web Service S3 and EC2 instances, and the Databricks browser based platform. 

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Home Energy Reports Behavioural Evaluation}{}{Project Manager}{Seattle, Washington}
\item[] Project Manager and Lead Data Scientist for the impact evaluation of client's Home Electricity Reports program, which used the Opower platform. The program was deployed with multiple overlapping randomized controlled trial experimental designs and a central part of the evaluation was identifying the appropriate way to estimate savings for all of the pieces.   Industry standard techniques for HER program evaluation were implemented. complete the impact evaluation.
\end{rSubsection}  

\begin{rSubsection}{Critical Peak Pricing Pilot Evaluation}{}{Lead Data Scientist}{Portland, Oregon}
\item[] Lead Data Scientist for an impact evaluation of clients's Critical Peak Pricing Pilot. Hourly regression models were estimated using Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) data and NOAA weather data. These models were transferred to an excel-based tool capable of estimating and visualizing impacts under different weather scenarios. 
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Dynamic Pricing Pilot Evaluation}{}{Lead Data Scientist}{State of Virginia}
\item[] Lead Data Scientist for an impact and process evaluation of client's Dynamic Pricing Pilot. This pilot provides time of use rates to residential and commercial customers as a price signal for them to reduce consumption during system peak hours. The evaluation report includes a load impact analysis, surveys to assess awareness, understanding, and acceptance of rate, and reporting for both residential and commercial participants. Residential participants have a matched control group; there are no matched controls for commercial participants.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Electric Vehicle Pilot Evaluation}{}{Lead Data Scientist}{State of Virginia}
\item[] Lead Data Scientist for a pilot involving time-of-use charging rates for electric vehicle owner's in Virginia. The project focused on whole house impacts for EV owners, as well as vehicle-charging only impacts. Statistical methods were used to enumerate differences between control and treatment average load shapes for the vehicle-charging only members. A synthetic control group was generated for the whole house treatment members.
\end{rSubsection}  

\begin{rSubsection}{Macroeconomic Modeling of State Commercial and Industrial Energy Sectors}{}{Lead Data Scientist}{State of Massachusetts}
\item[] Lead Data Scientist for a macroeconomic consumption modeling project of Massachusetts' Commercial and Industrial sectors. Our team developed a database of billing data pertaining to commercial and industrial premises for all energy efficiency program administrators in Massachusetts for three years. Along with NOAA weather data and economic data from the US Census Bureau and other sources, macroeconomic consumption models were used to estimate the impact of energy efficiency programs at the county and town level.
